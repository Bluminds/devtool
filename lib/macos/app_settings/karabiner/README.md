# Karabiner Settings

After installing Karabiner-elements, replace the file located in:  ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json

**NOTE:** The file in the repository remaps the CAPS_LOCK to BACKSPACE.  

You will need to disable in Macos the Caps_Lock:
1. Go to Settings->Keyboard
2. Select "Shortcuts" -> Modifier Keys
3. Set:  CapsLocks => No Action
